Manual, remote and locked doors.

.. note::

    Door textures come in two sizes: 64 and 128. When making your doorway, opt for a passage width to match.

Building a door
---------------

Use this method to make a basic door. It can be used as a base for a manual or a remote door.

* Join two sectors together with a passage

* Increase the grid detail as needed by pressing :kbd:`3-5`
* Enter vertices edit mode (:kbd:`v`)
* Add vertices for the door inside the passage

* Enter Linedef edit mode (:kbd:`l`) and select the front/rear sides of the door

* The door raises into the ceiling, set the front upper Sidedef texture to the `ICKDOOR1` texture.

Manual Doors
------------

Manual doors open when the player performs the USE action on the door.

* Enter Linedef edit mode (:kbd:`l`)
* Select both Linedefs of the door

* Choose the **Type** of the Linedefs as `1 DR Open Door`

To make the door open on a fixed track (the sides stay still while opening and closing):

* Select the track Linedefs
* Check the **upper unpeg** and **lower unpeg** options

.. note::

    The door line specials indicates that the sector facing the back of the Linedef is a door, this special does not need a tag either.

    The DR special can be opened repeatedly, while D1 can only be opened once.

Locked Doors
------------

Doors that require a blue, yellow or red key to open are created similarly to manual doors. When choosing the door Linedef type, pick one of the specials that target the keys:

Remote Doors
------------

Remote doors are opened through a switch.

* Enter Vertice edit mode (:kbd:`v`)
* Use the :kbd:`LMB` to insert vertices along the wall, make the Linedef 64 units long

.. image:: remote-01.png

* Enter Linedef edit mode (:kbd:`l`), select the new Linedef
* Choose the `SW1GRAY` switch texture

.. image:: remote-02.png

* Choose the Linedef **Type** as `63 SR Door Open`
* Move the mouse cursor over the grid to ensure focus is not stolen by the **Line Specials** panel
* Press :kbd:`;` then :kbd:`f` to apply a fresh tag to the Linedef

.. image:: remote-05.png

* Enter sector edit mode (:kbd:`s`), select the door sector

.. image:: remote-03.png

* Press :kbd:`;` then :kbd:`l` to apply the last tag to the door sector

.. image:: remote-06.png

* Eureka highlights both the sector and the Linedef that share the same tag. This shows us the two are linked:

.. note::

    The SR line special indicates a switch that can be toggled repeatedly, while S1 is a switch that can only be toggled once.
